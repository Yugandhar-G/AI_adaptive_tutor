3. **`question_id`**: The unique identifier of the question being answered
4. **`user_answer`**: The answer submitted by the student (typically: a, b, c, or d)
5. **`elapsed_time`**: The time spent by the student on each question (in seconds)


### Data Collection Benefits

This comprehensive tracking enables:
